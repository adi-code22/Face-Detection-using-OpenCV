# Face Detection using OpenCV and Cascade Classifier in Python.

The program detects human faces in a live camera with pre trained cascade frontal default file.
A machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained from a lot of positive and negative images, which is then used to detect objects in other images.
Applications of this project includes Face and Object Detection, Motion Capturing, Remote Monitoring etc.
